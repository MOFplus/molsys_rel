# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master

# later we can think of a different pool for molsys
pool: pylmps 

- script: |
    echo cd tests
    echo "do something"
  displayName: 'First molsys test'
